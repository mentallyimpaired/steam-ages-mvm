Hello Reflourished fans.

...if you dont know what reflourished is then you wont get the reference but lets just say its a pvz2 mod.

The .pop file needs to be in the "population" folder in this path: Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\scripts\population

If you don't have a population folder yet then just simply create one. 

Custom icons (vtf and vmt files) must be placed in Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\materials\hud

If you don't have a hud folder yet then you know what to do.

To play the mission, type in console: "map mvm_decoy" then call vote to change mission to bream_cage.

Also type in tf_forced_holiday 2 for zombie robots skin.
